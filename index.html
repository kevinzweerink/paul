                    <h4>Hidden</h4>
                    <p>Six years after her attack, Maggie Wilson receives a call from the prosecutor who put her husband in jail after Maggie identified him as the man who nearly killed her. Told that another inmate has confessed to the crime, Maggie plunges into memories of her stormy marriage to her college sweetheart, Nate Duke. Secluded in the old farmhouse that was her marital home, Maggie pores through trial transcripts, old journals, and photo albums, recreating the history of their courtship, trying fruitlessly to remember the events of that fateful night. <a href="#">View on Amazon &rarr;</a></p>
